/*Variables are containers for storing data values.

In C++, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:

    int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
    double - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
    char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
    string - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes
    bool - stores values with two states: true or false*/

int main() {
    /*Declaring (Creating) Variables
    type variableName = value*/
    int myNum = 15;               // Integer (whole number)
    cout << myNum << endl;       // Outputs 15 seperately

    /*You can also declare a variable without assigning the value, and assign the value later
    int myNum;
    myNum = 15;
    cout << myNum; */
